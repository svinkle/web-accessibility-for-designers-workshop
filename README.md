# Web Accessibility for Designers Workshop

Hello everyone, I'm Scott Vinkle, a front end developer and accessibility advocate at [Shopify](https://shopify.com/).

During this half day workshop we'll be covering quite a few different topics. All of which will be focused on usability, accessibility, and inclusive thinking in design and development.

Essentially what we'll be discussing is common accessibility issues found in design, how they affect different user groups, and ways to overcome the barriers introduced for people with disabilities.

## Agenda

The key takeaway here is when we **design with an inclusive mindset**, we can make any product work well for everyone, including people with disabilities.
