# What is accessibility?

When we speak about accessibility on the web we're talking about making sure our apps and web sites that we create are understandable and usable by people with disabilities.

Making something accessible does not only involve the code behind the app or site, but _a lot_ of what we design visually and the user experience we determine and set in place for our users plays a very large part in the accessibility of our products.

## Mindfulness is key

Consider this: When you're driving a car, it's crucial to pay attention to your surroundings. To be a successful driver, you must take into account other drivers, cyclists, road signs, and pedestrians. Without this consideration for others, you face the potential of getting into trouble quite quickly.

Along the same lines, as designers and developers, when you are mindful of people and the various ways they use and interact with your website you help ensure a positive user experience for all.

- If you consider someone in a remote area of the world with a poor connection speed, you'll make sure the site and all its assets will load quickly and perform optimally
- If you consider someone doing research and learning about a topic using a handheld device, you'll be sure to design a user interface that supports a wide range of device screen sizes and orientations
- If you consider someone who is blind, hard of hearing, motor impairments, or who has difficulty understanding written text on a page, then you'll code and structure content in a way that will help convey meaning and purpose for people who use and depend on assistive technology to experience the web.

What really happens is that as you start thinking of and developing for people with disabilities, you end up actually improving the usability of a site for all users.

## Disabilities

Who stands to benefit when we implement accessibility best practices? Who are the people that we're considering when we make these decisions? Well, in the end _everyone_ benefits, but specifically, someone with a disability such as:

- Visual impairments
- Deafness / hard of hearing
- Motor disabilities
- Vestibular issues / seizure disorders
- Cognitive disabilities
